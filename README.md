# react-redux

The idea here is to setup a very basic react application for absolute beginners. It demonstrates all the commonly used react hooks for any web project with examples. It also covers a very basic implementation for redux. Although the tasks are really small but they are important means to demonstrate how these technologies work. The project covers the following

1. React - useState, useEffect, useRef, useForm, router, async calls, custom hooks, etc.
2. Redux - Store, Reducers, Actions, Dispatch.
